# df-adventurer-exporter
DFHack scripts to export/import adventurers across worlds. For now, these scripts only handle attributes, skills, and professions. If you don't have DFHack, I recommend getting the [LazyNewbPack](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076),
which comes with it pre-installed.

**Made for DF v0.47.05, I have no idea if it works on previous versions!**

## Instructions
Simply drop both scripts in your `hack/scripts` directory and run via the DFHack Console.

Note: `exportadv` and `importadv` are both used in adventurer mode **after** character creation.
